# Assignment3_Hypothesis

Setting H0 and H1
## µ1 is the mean for unit 1
## µ2 is the mean for unit 2
## H0 : µ1= µ 2 (µ 1- µ 2=0) there is no significant difference
## H1: µ 1 ≠ µ 2(µ 1- µ 2≠0) there is a significant difference
### Alpha is α= 0.05
### Critical value is  Z=1.645
Find the var1 and var2 from the sample given 
### σ1=0.083179
### σ2=0.117924

We’ll do calculation using excel and python 
 
Calculate the critical value from z table ,as a significant level is given
Population greater than 30 We’ll use z-test for tow tail
